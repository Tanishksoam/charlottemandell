          That’s all I remember saying in the one letter I wrote to Maurice Blanchot, a few years before his death. I want to thank you for the silence in your words. I was working on my translation of <em>Le livre à venir</em>, and suddenly I felt an urgent need to write to Blanchot, simply to thank him for his work all these years, for all that he’s written, but especially for all that he has left unwritten: for the voice beneath the words, the sly, quiet, inner voice of all that’s left unsaid.
        </p>

          There is no such thing as a passive reader of Blanchot. Reading Blanchot becomes an active engagement; he involves the reader in his thinking; he makes the reader think, and respond, and question. Pick up any book of Blanchot, start reading anywhere, and before you’re even aware of it, you have become involved: he has engaged you in a conversation; something in you resists, but you read on; suddenly you discover the patience of true reading, the infinite patience required to tease out a subject, play with it, negate it, reassert it, leave it unresolved.

          After I heard of Blanchot’s death — <em>Blanchot s’efface</em>, wrote <em>Libération</em> — I felt a deep sorrow, as if a great presence had left us. I picked up <em>The Writing of the Disaster</em> and opened to this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "(A primal scene?) You who live later, close to a heart that beats no more, imagine, imagine this: the child — is he seven, eight perhaps? — standing, opening the drapes and, through the window, looking out. What he sees — garden, winter trees, wall of a house — while he sees, of course as a child would, the place where he plays, he grows tired and slowly looks up to the ordinary sky, with clouds, grey light, the dull daylight with no depth..."
        </blockquote>

          Maurice Blanchot’s death went largely unnoticed by the American media. While lengthy obituaries appeared overseas in the Guardian and the Independent, in America Blanchot’s death was greeted with silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blanchot’s books, when published in America, meet with the same indifference on the part of the American media. His fiction is granted a little more attention, but his books of essays remain for the most part un-reviewed.
        </p>

          But there is a Cult of Blanchot in America, confined mostly to universities and academic circles, although Blanchotophiles do turn up in odd places and reveal themselves in odd ways.
